## 🔑 API Keys & Setup Guide

To run this project, you need to obtain API keys from three services. Follow this step-by-step guide:

### 1. Serper.dev (Google Maps Search)
1.  Go to [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/).
2.  Sign up for a free account.
3.  On the dashboard, locate your **API Key**.
4.  Save this key; you will need it for `SERPER_API_KEY`.

### 2. OpenRouter (AI Processing)
1.  Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/).
2.  Sign up or log in.
3.  Navigate to **Keys** and create a new API Key.
4.  Save this key; you will need it for `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`.
    *   *Note: This project uses free models like Llama 3 by default, but you can configure it for others.*

### 3. Google Sheets API (Data Export)
This is the most critical step. You need a Service Account to write data to your sheet.

1.  **Create a Project**: Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Enable APIs**:
    *   Search for **"Google Sheets API"** and click **Enable**.
3.  **Create Credentials**:
    *   Go to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
    *   Click **+ CREATE CREDENTIALS** and select **Service account**.
    *   Give it a name (e.g., "leadfinder-bot") and click **Create and Continue**.
    *   (Optional) Grant the role **Editor** to the service account for the project.
    *   Click **Done**.
4.  **Get the Private Key**:
    *   Click on the newly created Service Account email (e.g., `leadfinder-bot@project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`).
    *   Go to the **Keys** tab.
    *   Click **Add Key > Create new key**.
    *   Select **JSON** and click **Create**. A file will download.
5.  **Configure Environment**:
    *   Open the downloaded JSON file.
    *   You need `client_email` for `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL`.
    *   You need `private_key` for `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY`.
6.  **Share the Sheet**:
    *   Create a new Google Sheet (e.g., "LeadFinder Results").
    *   Click the **Share** button in the top right.
    *   Paste the `client_email` (from step 5) into the share dialog.
    *   Give it **Editor** permissions.
    *   Copy the **Spreadsheet ID** from the URL:
        `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/`**`COPY_THIS_ID_PART`**`/edit`
    *   This is your `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID`.

## 📖 How to Use

### 1. Website Development Leads (Strict Filter)
If you want to find businesses that **don't have a website**, use terms like "website", "web design", or "no website" in your prompt.

*   **Prompt**: *"Find plumbers in Austin Texas that need a website"*
*   **Result**: The app lists plumbers *without* a website found on Google Maps. The "Push to Sheets" button will save them for your outreach campaign.

### 2. Digital Marketing / General Leads (Broad Search)
If you want to find **all businesses** in a category (e.g., for SEO, Ads, or B2B sales), use a standard search prompt.

*   **Prompt**: *"Digital marketing agencies in New York"* or *"Gyms in Miami"*
*   **Result**: The app lists all matching businesses. Cards will show "Visit Website" for those that have one, and "No website found" for those that don't.

### 3. Saving Data
*   Review the results on the dashboard.
*   Click the green **"Push to Sheets"** button.
*   The data (Name, Address, Phone, Rating, Website URL) will be appended to your connected Google Sheet instantly.
